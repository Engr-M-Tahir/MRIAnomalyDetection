# Autoencoder-Based Anomaly Detection in Brain MRI Scans
 # Project Overview

This project implements an unsupervised anomaly detection system using convolutional autoencoders to identify chronic brain infarcts and tumor-like anomalies in MRI scans. Inspired by the work of van Hespen et al. (2021), our approach trains the autoencoder only on healthy brain MRI scans. When tested with abnormal scans, higher reconstruction errors indicate potential infarcts or other anomalies.

The goal is to support radiologists by providing an automated tool that flags suspicious regions, reducing human error and improving early diagnosis in neurological disorders.

 # Key Features

* Autoencoder Architecture — Convolutional encoder-decoder structure with symmetric layers for reconstruction.

* Unsupervised Learning — Model trained only on healthy brain scans, making it effective for anomaly detection without labeled infarct data.

* Pixel-wise Anomaly Scoring — Reconstruction error (MSE) is computed for each pixel to localize anomalies.

* Dynamic Thresholding — Anomaly threshold calculated as

* Threshold=μ(healthy scores)+1×σ(healthy scores)

* Evaluation Metrics — Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix.

* Visualization — Heatmaps highlight anomalous regions in test MRI scans.

 # Methodology
1. Dataset

Source: Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection – Kaggle

Size: 253 images (healthy + abnormal).

# Preprocessing:

* Grayscale conversion

* Resizing to 128×128 pixels

* Normalization

2. Model Architecture

* Input: 1-channel MRI (128×128)

Encoder:

* Conv2d (1→32) → ReLU

* Conv2d (32→64) → ReLU

* Conv2d (64→128) → ReLU

* Flatten → Linear → Latent Space (256 neurons)

Decoder:

* Linear → Reshape

* ConvTranspose2d (128→64) → ReLU

* ConvTranspose2d (64→32) → ReLU

* ConvTranspose2d (32→1) → Sigmoid

* Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)

3. Training

* Framework: PyTorch

* Optimizer: Adam (lr = 0.001)

* Batch size: 32

* Epochs: 50

* Early Stopping: Enabled

 # Results

* Confusion Matrix:

|                 | Predicted No Tumor | Predicted Tumor |
| --------------- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| Actual No Tumor | 78 (TN)            | 13 (FP)         |
| Actual Tumor    | 0 (FN)             | 154 (TP)        |


Metrics:

* Precision: 0.92

* Recall: 1.0

* F1-Score: 0.96

Observations:

* Clear heatmap-based localization of anomalous regions.

* Small/low-contrast infarcts remain challenging.

* False positives occasionally triggered by natural brain structures.

 # Limitations

* Operates on 2D slices only; no volumetric context.

* Threshold selection is empirical, may vary across datasets.

* Domain shift across scanners or acquisition protocols can impact performance.

 # Future Work

* Extend to 2.5D or 3D autoencoders for richer spatial understanding.

* Explore semi-supervised learning to leverage limited labeled infarct data.

* Apply morphological post-processing to reduce false positives.

* Investigate transfer learning for generalization across diverse MRI protocols.
